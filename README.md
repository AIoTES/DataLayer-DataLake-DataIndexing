# DL-Data_Indexing

## Development



    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

    ./mvnw
    yarn start

## Building for production

To optimize the DataIntegration application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using Simlife in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./mvnw clean test



## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)


For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build dockerfile:tag@version dockerfile:tag@commit

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
